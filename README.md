Pikachu's Pokeball Dodger Game
---


## About

This is a web browser game that I made for a friend. It is a spinoff of the Rock Dodger game that I built using Flatiron School's free Javascript course. The player takes control of pikachu, and the purpose of the game is to dodge the pokeballs falling from the top of the container.
